# Udacity Neighborhood Map Project

## How to Run

At the time of writing, this project is up on my github pages account. Otherwise, run the project as you normally would by opening index.html or setting up a local server.

## How to Use

The application opens with the map centered on my home town. To begin, enter any city or address into the "Enter a city or address: " text field. Tapping enter or clicking the submit button submits the form.

Submitting the "Enter a city or address: " form pans the map to the new location and displays a default list of places.

To see a filtered list of places, enter a query and a distance in miles into the "Query" and "Distance" text fields of the "Filter places: " form. Tapping enter or clicking the submit button submits the form.

Submitting the "Filter places: " form displays a filtered list of places and resizes the map to fit them all. To reset the map to the unfiltered results, use the Reset button.

To view more information about a place, click on a marker or a list item. This displays an infowindow above the marker and additional information about the place in the interface. To return to the place list, click the "< Back" button.
